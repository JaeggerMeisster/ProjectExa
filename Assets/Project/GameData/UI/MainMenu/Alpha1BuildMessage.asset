    This is my first build for Project Exa.

    I''ve
    been working on this build for only a month, but this is not my first attempt
    at this game.

    There is not a lot to see here for now, only a buggy editor
    with 3 blocks, but i hope to release a new build at the second sunday of every
    month.

    Oh, and the game will be some kind of wave survival strategy.'
