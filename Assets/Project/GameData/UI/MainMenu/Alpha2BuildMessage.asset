  buildMessage: "Hello there!\n\nThe second month of development on this game is
    upon me, and i'm glad to say i've reached a level of polish UI-wise that i'm
    pretty happy about. \n\nThis update i've added audio, a settings menu, blueprint
    thumbnails and blueprint sharing.\n\nBut ofcourse no one cares about a game that
    has no gameplay, so that's what im going to focus from now on. I hope to have
    very basic controls down by next update. \n\nIf you encounter any bugs, please
    report them on the community tab on the itch.io page."
