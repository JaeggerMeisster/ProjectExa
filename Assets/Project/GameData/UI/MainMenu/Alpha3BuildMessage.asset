    This is the third update for the game, it''s
    not as big as the others, but it''s something.

    I''ve reworked the console,
    fixed some bugs with the editor and worked on cleaning up current systems and
    making stuff like grids and such more performant.


    You can now actually
    press play and select ships and stuff. Next update ill work on unit movement,
    and more advanced controls. '
